/*
Interface (implements) vs Sub-Class (extends)...

The distinction is that implements means that you're using the elements of a Java Interface in your
class, and extends means that you are creating a subclass of the class you are extending. You can
only extend one class in your new class, but you can implement as many interfaces as you would like.

Interface:  A Java interface is a bit like a class, except a Java interface can only contain method
signatures and fields. An Java interface cannot contain an implementation of the methods, only the
signature (name, parameters and exceptions) of the method. You can use interfaces in Java as a way
to achieve polymorphism.

Abstract:  Abstract classes are similar to interfaces.  You cannot instantiate them, and they may
contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. However, with abstract classes,
you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private
concrete methods.

Subclass: A Java subclass is a class which inherits a method or methods from a Java superclass.
A Java class may be either a subclass, a superclass, both, or neither!

Polymorphism:  Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use
of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.

ArrayList supports dynamic arrays that can grow as needed.

public class BaseActor3D 
{
    
    /* The class simulates the basic functionality of an Actor class in LibGDX, but in a 3D environment.

    The transformation data for a ModelInstance object is stored in its transform field as a Matrix4 object:
    a four-by-four grid of numbers.  From this object, a Vector3 can be extracted that contains the position 
    of the object.  Another Vector3 can be extracted that contains the scaling factor in each direction 
    (initialized to 1 in all directions, which results in no change in the default size).  The transformation 
    also stores the orientation of the model, which cannot be stored with a single number (in contrast to the 
    rotation value of an Actor), because an object in three-dimensional space can be rotated any amount around
    any combination of the x, y, and z axes.  For many technical reasons (such as computation, performance,
    and avoiding a phenomena known as gimbal lock2), an object called a Quaternion (corresponding to a
    mathematical object of the same name) is used to store orientation data.  For convenience, rather than 
    work with the Matrix4 directly, separate objects store the position, rotation, and scale data for
    each BaseActor3D object.  The objects will be combined into a Matrix4 and stored in the ModelInstance when 
    needed.
    
    Methods include:

    act:  Updates the transformation data of the model instance.
    addPosition:  Adds the passed vector or combination of coordinates (x, y, z) to the current position.
    calculateTransform:  Combines the position, rotation, and scale data into a Matrix4 object.
    clone:  Returns a BaseActor3D with the same properties as the current.
    copy:  Copies properties from the passed to the current BaseActor3D.
    draw:  Renders the model instance using the supplied ModelBatch and Environment.
    getBoundingPolygon:
    getPosition:  Returns the position of the 3D actor -- as a vector.
    getTurnAngle:  Returns the angle in radians of the rotation around the Y axis.
    moveForward:  Moves the 3D actor forward by the specified amount.
    moveRight:  Moves the 3D actor right by the specified amount.
    moveUp:  Moves the 3D actor up by the specified amount.
    overlaps:
    setColor:  Changes the color of all materials belonging to the model instance to the passed value.
    setEllipseBase:
    setModelInstance:  Sets the model instance to the passed object.
    setPosition:  Uses a vector parameter or combination of coordinates (x, y, z) to set the position of
      the 3D actor.
    setRectangleBase:
    setTurnAngle:  Sets the angle in radians of the rotation around the Y axis.
    turn:  Adjusts the angle in radians of the rotation around the Y axis by the passed value.

    Movement Information:

    initial position of the camera will have a positive z coordinate, and the actor will be 
    facing away from the camera.  Similarly, the initial upward direction is the vector 
    (0, 1, 0), and the rightward direction is the vector (1, 0, 0).  After the actor has been 
    rotated, the relative forward, upward, and rightward directions can be determined by 
    transforming these original vectors by the actor's current rotation.  Then, to move a given 
    distance in one of these relative directions, scale the corresponding vector by the desired 
    distance, and add the result to the current position.
